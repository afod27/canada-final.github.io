        Some of the Passport text in the prototype was AI Generated. I wrote everything up to "if you're one of the good ones." and then asked Chat-GPT to complete the text with the same tone to make it 250 words. <br>The specific visa bullet points are a mix between my own text and the actual requirements from the Canadian Government website. Everything else was written by me. Some lines of the final website CSS were generated by GPT, and are marked by a comment.
