      <h4>The website's core stayed the same, but its execution changed.</h4>

      <p>For my midterm proposal, I wanted to some of the many issues the Canadian bureaucracy has. While coding the final site, I soon realised that it would have been too ambitious. Instead, I decided to focus on the absurdity of the buraucratic process of getting a canadian visa. Moreover, I was not originally planning on making the "Help Center" or "Contact Us" link work at all. However, Santo gave me the idea of using those links as narative enforcers - demonstrating the pain of dealing with the lack of help - during my proposal critique and I found it genious.<br>I created 2 media queries, one for 1080px width and above & one for 780px and below. I needed the first media query because I was working on both my large monitor at home and my small laptop, and the changing displays was messing up my layout. So the easiest solution was to create two very similar but different layouts so that my web page would look good no matter the display width.</p>

      <p>The index page stayed the same as conceptualised in my prototype. I added some animations and transitions to make the page look better. I used flexbox for almost everything on my pages. I did have a vertion of the index page where I used grid instead of flexbox, but it never looked quite right. I also changed the images I displayed from nice landscapes to accurate representation of the city to make it more obvious that the site is a parody. Moreover, I changed the title of my articles to be more chocking and engaging. I adapted a serious and mostly neutral tone throughout my copywrite while saying out-of-pocket things to play on the boundary between straight copy and parody. <br> The index page is the only one where the mobile media query work; I did not do it for the rest.</p>

      <p>The visa page is the only one of the navigation hyperlinks other than "Fran√ßais" that lead to an actual article, the rest leads to an error page saying that the page is under construction and to come back later. This page is similar to that of my prototype.<br>The specific visa pages were a brand new addition to the website. I was inspired from my prototype's passport page. The bullet points ended up being smaller. I was unable to change the size of the marker in my css without affecting the rest of the 'li'. It did end up working in my favor as I had not realised the sheer amount of actual requirements needed for visa applications. Having bigger markers would have been too distracting and removed from the sleekiness of the page.</p>
